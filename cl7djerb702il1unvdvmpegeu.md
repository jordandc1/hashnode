Today I am going to share my experience with you about how to solve problems as a developer. I hope this article will save you time when you got stuck. 

# State the problem
Try to state the problem, and keep it short and concise. This is very important if you want to ask someone, and it will also help you to understand the problem itself.

# Don't focus on the phenomenon
Most junior developers will make this mistake. When you face a problem, you should think about the underlying causes, and list all of them.

# Analysis of the causes
When you got your list of causes, you should sort the list by the possibility and the time cost. Then go through the list one by one, and cross out the unrelated items on the list.

# Fix the problem
Now you have the causes of the problem, you should try to come out with a solution for it. Trust me, do not give up this opportunity of making progress to someone else, try to solve this problem by yourself.

# Ask for help
If you cannot solve the problem, then you need to ask for help. When you ask a question in the public community, please follow the rules of the community.

# Go for a walk
Now you should take a break, and maybe go through the steps when you come back. Remember, not all problems can be solved!
